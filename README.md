# instaBot

Steps to create session file (recommended to use a dummy account):
  - Install "instaloader" package from pip.
  - Open cmd, run "instaloader --login YOUR_USERNAME" and follow the steps.
  - Location of created session file: "%LOCALAPPDATA%\Instaloader\session-YOUR-USERNAME"
  - Rename created session file with YOUR_USERNAME (by default, it will be created as "session-YOUR_USERNAME", remove "session-").
  - Place it inside --> .data-files/session-file in your instaBot folder.
  - Session won't be used to download every reel/post, only if the reel/post isn't available to download without login, login session will be used.
